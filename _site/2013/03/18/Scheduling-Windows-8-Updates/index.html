<p>Recently a few of my friends and colleagues migrated from Windows 7 to Windows 8. One of the more annoying parts of the operating system is the constant barrage of new updates (due to it being relatively fresh on playground). Well, if you're tired of having to wait 5 minutes to use your computer every few days when logging on due to Windows Update you can alleviate this problem!</p>

<p>These quick and easy steps will allow you to set a <strong>maintenance window</strong> for Windows 8. That means that your system will install updates at the time you specify.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open explorer.exe (Windows Explorer)</li>
    <li>In the address bar enter:
<em>Control Panel\System and Security\Action Center\Automatic Maintenance</em></li>
    <li>Set a time!</li>
    <li>Select "allow scheduled maintenance to wake your computer" if your system has the chance of being turned off at the time you set.</li>
    <li>Select "OK" and enjoy piece of mind of not being annoyed by updates.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, you can stop letting Windows update from doing what is really important: <a title="cat videos" href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cat+videos&amp;oq=cat+videos" target="_blank">watching cat videos</a>.</p>
