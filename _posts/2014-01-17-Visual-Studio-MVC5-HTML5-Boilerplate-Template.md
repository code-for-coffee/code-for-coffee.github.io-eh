title: Visual Studio MVC4 HTML5 Boilerplate Template
---

I've been working with <strong>ASP.NET MVC4</strong> lately and decided to throw together a template for Visual Studio. This template works with Visual Studio 2010, 2012, and 2013. It provides a great quick start to any web application and includes the following based on <a href="http://www.initializr.com/">Initializr's</a> HTML5 boilerplate generator:
<ul>
	<li>Mobile first, responsive (via normalize.css)</li>
	<li>Modernizr (2.6.2)</li>
	<li>Minified jQuery (1.10.1)</li>
	<li>IE Classes</li>
	<li>Chrome Frame support (until Google kills it off)</li>
	<li>Favicon</li>
	<li>Apple Touch Icons</li>
</ul>
You can grab the code on <a href="https://github.com/code-for-coffee/visualstudio-mvc4-html5-boilerplate-template/">github</a>. Install it by placing the contents in your <em>C:\Users\username\Documents\Visual Studio 20xx\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#\</em> directory.  To get started with the template please take a look at how all of the views are setup.

Please feel free to report anything that doesn't work here or on the <a href="https://github.com/code-for-coffee/visualstudio-mvc4-html5-boilerplate-template/issues">github issues page</a>.
